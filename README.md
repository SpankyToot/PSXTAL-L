# PSXTAL-L
Lightened version of VajSkids/L10N37's PSXTAL project (V1.00Bx) using his DFO board and an Arduino NANO<br />
My goal is to merge it with his modchip making my PU-18 a single Nano system with a modchip and region swapping capability.<br />

### V1.00<br />
Started to remove IGR related code<br />

### V1.01<br />
Have removed the code completely and tested its functionality.<br />

### V2.00<br />
After talking to VajSkids I had enough understanding of the function to re-write the code to run as Analog rather than Digital. This allows the use of Ports B and D exclusively for the modchip.
